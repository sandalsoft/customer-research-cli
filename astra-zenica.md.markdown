**Inferred Role:** Pharmaceutical Scientist

### Use Cases

#### Literature Review Automation
PromptQL can be used to automate the extraction and summarization of key information from vast volumes of scientific literature. By querying large language models, pharmaceutical scientists can quickly gather data on the latest research findings, drug interactions, and clinical trial results, improving efficiency and ensuring they have access to the most current information.

#### Drug Interaction Prediction
Utilize PromptQL to query large language models for predicting potential drug interactions. By inputting specific chemical compounds and existing medications, scientists can use the model's vast database of known interactions to identify possible adverse effects, thus aiding in the development of safer pharmaceutical products.

#### Formulation Development Support
PromptQL can assist in formulation development by querying for optimal ingredient combinations and proportions based on desired therapeutic outcomes. This can include querying the model for insights on solubility, bioavailability, and stability of formulations, assisting scientists in designing more efficient drug delivery systems.

### Example Queries

#### Compound Interaction Analysis
This query helps pharmaceutical scientists analyze interactions between two chemical compounds. It utilizes the data retrieval feature to gather information from multiple scientific databases.

```
SELECT interaction_details FROM chemical_database WHERE compound_A = 'aspirin' AND compound_B = 'ibuprofen';
```

#### Automated Literature Review
This query allows the scientist to perform an automated literature review on recent advancements in drug delivery systems, using the natural language understanding feature to summarize key findings.

```
SUMMARIZE LITERATURE topic = 'drug delivery systems' FROM publications WHERE date >= '2023-01-01';
```

#### Predictive Modeling for Drug Efficacy
This query leverages machine learning capabilities to predict the efficacy of a new drug formulation based on historical data. It uses predictive analytics to provide insights into potential outcomes.

```
PREDICT efficacy FOR new_drug_formulation USING historical_data WHERE factors = ('dosage', 'patient_age', 'administration_method');
```
