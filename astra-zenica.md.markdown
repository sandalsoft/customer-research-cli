**Inferred Role:** Pharmaceutical Scientist

### Use Cases

#### Optimizing Drug Formulation Processes
PromptQL can analyze data from past drug formulations and trial outcomes to identify patterns and correlations between formulation parameters and drug efficacy or stability. This helps pharmaceutical scientists optimize the formulation process by highlighting the most effective ingredient combinations and process conditions, reducing the time and cost of development.

#### Predictive Analysis of Compound Efficacy
Utilize PromptQL to evaluate datasets from preclinical and clinical trials to predict the efficacy of new compounds. By identifying trends and similarities with previous successful compounds, scientists can focus their efforts on the most promising candidates, improving the success rate of drug development and ensuring resources are allocated efficiently.

#### Streamlining Regulatory Compliance
PromptQL can analyze regulatory documentation and compliance data to ensure that new drug developments meet all necessary regulatory requirements. By cross-referencing internal data with regulatory standards, PromptQL can highlight potential compliance issues early in the development process, reducing the risk of delays and ensuring a smoother path to market.

### Example Queries

#### Chemical Compound Interaction Analysis
This query helps a pharmaceutical scientist understand the interactions between two specific chemical compounds, which is crucial for drug formulation.

```
{'select': 'interaction_effects', 'from': 'chemical_compounds_database', 'where': {'compound_1': 'Aspirin', 'compound_2': 'Ibuprofen'}, 'output': 'summary'}
```

#### Latest Research on Target Protein
This query retrieves the most recent research articles related to a specific protein target, aiding in drug discovery and development.

```
{'select': 'research_articles', 'from': 'scientific_journals', 'where': {'protein_target': 'PD-L1'}, 'order_by': 'publication_date DESC', 'limit': 5}
```

#### Adverse Effects Prediction for New Drug
This query uses predictive modeling to estimate potential adverse effects of a new drug in early development stages.

```
{'predict': 'adverse_effects', 'using_model': 'toxicology_predictor', 'with_inputs': {'drug_composition': 'new_drug_formula', 'dosage_levels': [10, 20, 50]}, 'output': 'probability_distribution'}
```

### Visualization Ideas

#### Drug Interaction Network Graph
A visualization that maps out the interactions between various compounds and their effects, helping to identify potential drug candidates and side effects. This network graph will use nodes to represent compounds and edges to represent interactions, with varying thickness to indicate interaction strength.

**Visualization Type:** network_graph

#### Compound Efficacy Heatmap
A heatmap that displays the efficacy of different compounds across various biological targets. Rows represent different compounds, while columns represent biological targets. Color intensity indicates the level of efficacy, allowing scientists to quickly identify promising candidates for further development.

**Visualization Type:** heatmap

#### Time-Series Analysis of Clinical Trial Outcomes
A line chart that plots the progression of clinical trial outcomes over time for various compounds. This visual allows pharmaceutical scientists to track trends, observe anomalies, and assess the long-term potential of their drugs. Each line will represent a different compound, with markers indicating significant events or milestones in the trial process.

**Visualization Type:** line_chart
