The use of PromptQL can dynamically update this heatmap with the latest data, providing real-time insights.

An interactive timeline that tracks the stages of ongoing and completed mergers and acquisitions that the investment banker is involved in. Each entry on the timeline shows key details such as deal value, status, and involved parties. PromptQL can be used to fetch and filter data based on specific criteria, such as industry or region, providing tailored views for strategic decision-making.

#### Risk Exposure Network Graph
A network graph that visualizes the interconnectedness of different financial instruments and entities in the investment banker's portfolio. Nodes represent individual assets or entities, while edges illustrate their relationships and dependencies. The size and color of nodes can reflect risk levels, enabling the banker to assess potential areas of systemic risk. PromptQL queries can dynamically adjust the graph based on real-time data inputs, providing a clear picture of evolving risk scenarios.
